"""Score progression and saturation reading (issue #91).

`model_cards.py` answers "which benchmarks do vendors report" by counting
mentions. That is the 上榜 question: a benchmark enters the field's shared
vocabulary when a new organization first puts it in front of readers. It says
nothing about whether the benchmark is still hard.

This module answers the other half, from `data/benchmark_scores.yml`: where a
real number was read out of a real document, how have reported scores moved?
The two readings are published against one time axis so a reader can see the
case the issue asks about -- a benchmark that everyone adopts *and* whose
headroom is closing -- without having to hold two charts in their head.

WHY A HISTORICAL BEST IS NOT A SATURATION VERDICT

The data file states the trap plainly and this module is built to respect it: a
running maximum rises or stays flat by construction, so a flat run is not
evidence of saturation. It is equally consistent with vendors having stopped
reporting the benchmark, with a protocol change, or with nobody having published
since. The benchmark-wide historical-best frontier is therefore a presentation
of record-setting observations, not evidence of a trend or a ceiling. Three
analytical readings are computed and published separately, and none of
them is allowed to be read as the others:

`best`
    The highest comparable value on record, with the date and document that
    produced it. A fact about the corpus, not about the benchmark's ceiling.
`headroom`
    Distance from `best` to the metric's own bound, when the metric has one.
    This is what "saturated" can mean without a trend claim: an instrument
    scored at 92 of a possible 100 has 8 points left whether or not anyone
    reports it again.
`comparable_series`
    Only the runs the join rule actually permits: identical instrument AND
    identical protocol. Everything else stays an unconnected point.

THE SAMPLE IS SMALL AND THE READING SAYS SO

Under the strict join rule this corpus yields very few multi-date runs, and most
of those are one vendor reporting its own successive models. That is a real
property of vendor reporting, not a bug to be engineered around by relaxing the
join, so `evidence_grade` labels each benchmark with what its rows can and
cannot support. A two-point single-vendor run is reported as such and never
described as a field-wide trend.

Scores also stop earlier than mentions do. Every 2026-dated card in the registry
is listed as unread in the data file, so a benchmark can be actively adopted in
2026 with no score after mid-2025. `score_gap_days` measures that lag explicitly,
because a chart drawn without it would show a flat score line beside a climbing
adoption line and invite "saturated" as the explanation when "unread" is the
actual one.
