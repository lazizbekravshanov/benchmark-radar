"""Publish one page per collection day under /blog/.

The site already had two ways to look at the daily corpus: the dashboard's
Today view, which shows one day at a time behind JavaScript, and feed.xml,
which lists a one-line count summary per day. Neither is a page. The briefing
text, the six question answers, the cited statistics and the counter-views that
the pipeline writes into every snapshot were stored and never displayed
anywhere a reader or a crawler could reach them, so the most readable thing the
project produces was also its least visible.

This module gives each committed snapshot a URL. Every page is derived from the
snapshot and only from the snapshot, so the output directory is generated,
gitignored, and replaced wholesale on each build rather than patched. A day
that leaves the history loses its page in the same run, which is why the whole
tree is staged and swapped instead of written in place: a half-written blog
that still serves last build's pages under this build's sitemap is worse than
no blog.

Calendar days with no snapshot get no page. Inventing an empty post for a day
the collector did not run would put a URL in the sitemap that reports nothing,
and the gap in the archive is itself accurate: it says the radar did not
collect that day.
