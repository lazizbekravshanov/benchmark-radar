    Issue #72 asked for trend values to be bound to the taxonomy that produced
    them, after PR #67 moved the cumulative `agentic` count from 3 to 78. That
    was a rules change, not 75 new agent benchmarks, and nothing in a snapshot
    recorded which rules had run: two days classified under different taxonomies
    were indistinguishable, so a measurement fix read as a domain explosion.

    Derived from the taxonomy's own content rather than hand-bumped. A version
    a maintainer has to remember to increment is a version that silently stops
    being true the first time someone edits a keyword list and forgets, which
    is exactly the failure this is meant to detect. Editing any term changes
    the digest; nothing else can.

    The digest covers the category names, their terms, and the structure of a
    proximity rule, canonicalized so that reordering *categories* in
    `config.yml` without changing what matches does not invent a new version
    and force a false "not comparable" on every trend.

    Term order inside a category is deliberately significant, unlike category
    order. `rescore` records only the first two matching terms in a record's
    "Matched:" rationale, so listing the same terms in a different order
    produces different stored evidence for the same artifact. That is a real
    change in output, and a version that called those two runs identical would
