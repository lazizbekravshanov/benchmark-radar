    The remedy is a change of units and nothing more. Multiplying a whole
    series by a constant preserves every ordering and every ratio in it and
    asserts nothing about a ceiling, which is the distinction `catalog`
    cares about: it refuses to emit a `display_scale` because a declared maximum
